## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Auth fix is highest priority -- blocks all other work
- [Roadmap]: UW Madison is primary launch campus -- all data pipeline work targets Madison first
- [Roadmap]: Roommate matching deferred to v2 -- cold-start problem, needs established user base
- [Phase 01-02]: Root URL redirects to /uw-madison/cribai for chat-first experience
- [Phase 01-01]: Extracted isEduEmail to lib/edu-validation.ts for testability and reuse
- [Phase 01-01]: Default auth redirect changed to /uw-madison/cribai (primary launch campus)
- [Phase 01-03]: Profile completion tracked via profile_completed_at timestamp (dual purpose: DB state + modal suppression)
- [Phase 01-03]: Avatar is initials-only for Phase 1, avatar_url column reserved for future upload
- [Phase 01-03]: Modal skip uses localStorage + DB column for dual persistence
- [Deferred]: AI disclaimer for CribAI (not a legal expert) -- user feedback, tracked for future phase

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- ~~Magic link auth redirect is broken~~ -- FIXED in 01-01
- pg_cron availability on Supabase free tier needs verification before Phase 4 (alert scheduling)
- Fair Housing Act compliance flagged by research -- relevant for semantic search embedding inputs
